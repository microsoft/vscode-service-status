# Visual Studio Code Service Status

This repository is used by the Visual Studio Code team to track live site incidents impacting services that power Visual Studio Code experiences (eg: [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync), [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web)). All customer impacting incidents will have a corresponding issue in this repository, that will be updated throughout the lifecycle of the incident.
